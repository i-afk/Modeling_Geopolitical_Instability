This is a repository for iterations of my final project, during my MS in Quantitative Economics, which aims to model geopolitical instability from economic data. I'm currently in the process of rebuilding the project using a wider variety of data sources in an attempt to improve its predictive power. The ultimate goal of this project is to quantify the risks when doing business in or otherwise interacting with a certain region in an era of increasing geopolitical instability.
